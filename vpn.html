<h2>Vpn Explained</h2>
<p>
A virtual private network (VPN) gives you online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network from a public internet connection.
 VPNs mask your internet protocol (IP) address so your online actions are virtually untraceable. Most important, VPN services establish
 secure and encrypted connections to provide greater privacy than even a secured Wi-Fi hotspot.
